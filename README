Installation:

Move files into zencart installation root.  Move file under admin to whatever your zen cart custom admin directory is.  

Enable in payment modules and enter your bitcoind rpc information.  
Under admin->reports navigation you will find a link "Bitcoin Payment" to view admin/bitcoin.php which lists all accounts, payments made, and invoice balance for easy order/payment review.

Created static link under admin->reports to view bitcoin payments recieved.
The default link under extra was not working for me so therefore i added this one (wich i found to be a more suitable place also).
